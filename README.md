:nerd_face: : Welcome to the repository of **Daniel Brito Presents Fun with Flags using HTML and CSS**. Over the next weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of *vexillology*, through studying and designing flags of the world using just *HTML and CSS*.

:thinking: : Hang on, Daniel. What’s vexillology?

:nerd_face: : Vexillology is the study of flags.

:grinning: : Cool. I think I just learned something.

:nerd_face: : Did you have fun doing it?

:star_struck: : I’ll say.

:nerd_face: : So, check out my collection on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/DmYQoQ).
